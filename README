[Note: Original OpenOCD README had been moved to README.openocd]

This README assumes you want to compile OpenOCD and use
it with jtagd, or jtagserv.exe distributed with Quartus

It also assume you are reading this file because you 
want to or need to recompile OpenOCD with the driver
to access jtagd/jtagserv.exe, i.e. jclient.

PREREQUISITE:

You need to compile and install libjclient, which
should had been distributed together with this
source code.


COMPILATION STEPS:

Linux:

(1) Create directory lib64 as need be.
Copy libjclient.so and libjclient.so.*,
and libSafeString.so and libSafeString.so.* to
src/jtag/jclient/lib64. Take care not to copy
any *.la file.

(2) Run :
      
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --prefix=$(pwd) --enable-jclient
  make

(3) You should now be able to run openocd using the
following instructions:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/src/jtag/jclient/lib64:$LD_LIRBARY_PATH
  src/openocd

(4) If you run "make install", then normally we can expect 
the command:

  openocd

to work
      


Windows:

Only compilation using MinGW64-64bit is supported

(1) Create directory win64 as need be. 
Copy libjclient.dll to src/jtag/jclient/win64. 
Take care not to copy any *.la files

(2) Run 
  
  export CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=1 -Wno-error"; 
  export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Wno-error"
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --disable-doxygen-pdf \
     --enable-jclient --enable-ftdi --enable-jlink --enable-ulink \
     --build=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
  make
  cp /opt/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll ./src

(3) You should now be able to run openocd using the
following instructions:

  export PATH=$(pwd)/src/jtag/jclient/win64:$LD_LIRBARY_PATH
  src/openocd.exe

(4) If you run "make install", then normally we can expect 
the command:

  openocd.exe

to work
