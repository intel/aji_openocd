[Note: Original OpenOCD README had been moved to README.openocd]

This README assumes you want to compile OpenOCD and use
it with jtagd, or jtagserv.exe distributed with Quartus.

It also assume you are reading this file because you 
want to or need to recompile OpenOCD with the driver
to access jtagd/jtagserv.exe, i.e. aji_client.

As conditional compilation was used when compiling
OpenOCD with aji_client driver, you will not be able
to use the compiled openocd with other drivers at all.

PREREQUISITE:

You need to compile and install libaji_client, which
should had been distributed together with this
source code.


COMPILATION STEPS:

Linux:

(1) Create directory lib64 as need be.
Copy libaji_client.so and libaji_client.so.*,
and libSafeString.so and libSafeString.so.* to
src. Take care not to copy
any *.la file.

(2) Run :
      
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --enable-aji_client
  make

(3) You should now be able to run openocd using the
following instructions:

  src/openocd

(4) If you run "make install", then normally we can expect 
the command:

  openocd

to work, provided you copy libSafeString.so and libaji_client.* to the
same directory as openocd
      


Windows:

Only compilation using MinGW64-64bit is supported

(1) Create directory win64 as need be. 
Copy libaji_client.dll to src/jtag/aji_client/win64. 
Take care not to copy any *.la files

(2) Run 
  
  export CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=1 -Wno-error"; 
  export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Wno-error"
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --disable-doxygen-pdf \
     --enable-aji_client --enable-ftdi --enable-jlink --enable-ulink \
     --build=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
  make
  cp /opt/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll ./src

(3) You should now be able to run openocd using the
following instructions:

  src/openocd.exe

(4) If you run "make install", then normally we can expect 
the command:

  openocd.exe

to work, provided you copy libSafeString.so and libaji_client.* to the
same directory as openocd
